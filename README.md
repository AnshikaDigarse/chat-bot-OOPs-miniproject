# Chat System (Python OOP Mini Project)

A simple console-based chat system built using Python.  
This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
through a mini chatroom simulation.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate core
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python by building a
realistic, console-based chat system.

This project focuses on:
- Designing classes with clear responsibilities
- Understanding object interaction
- Using class variables for shared data
- Structuring a small Python project for GitHub

It serves as a learning project for beginners to strengthen their
Python OOP fundamentals.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add timestamps to each message
- Support private (one-to-one) messaging
- Allow multiple chatrooms
- Add user status (online/offline)
- Convert the project to menu-driven user input
- Improve error handling and validations
